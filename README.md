This README.md document is for the purpose of documenting what we have produced during the group project and how we went about producing the final result of a programme that can solve Schrödinger’s equation and display it as an animated graph. 

Initially, we ran some tests to work out how GitHub worked such as setting up an initial issue and working out how to push files onto a repository. 

Tom worked out how to create branches and set up a branch for everyone in the project so that we could put in small bits of code as we went along, and this allowed us to find what worked best for the project before pushing any code into the main repository. 

Lizzie made an initial test for a graph in her branch and worked out how to animate the plot, but it needed improvement as it was only for a certain set of values, whereas we wanted to make it so that people using the programme could input their own values. 

Mahin and Alfie then worked to create a code that works when using different input styles such as forloops or matrices and then plotting them. 

Jake began working on how to then package the finished code to create a usable package that can be used on python.
