This README.md document is for the purpose of documenting what we have produced during the group project and how we went about producing the final result of a programme that can solve Schrödinger’s equation and display it as an animated graph. 

Initially, we ran some tests to work out how GitHub worked such as setting up an initial issue and working out how to push files onto a repository. 

Tom worked out how to create branches and set up a branch for everyone in the project so that we could put in small bits of code as we went along, and this allowed us to independantly operate on sections of the program whilst both using eachothers for reference and customise our own versions without hindering eachother. 

Lizzie made an initial test for a graph in her branch and worked out how to animate the plot, but it needed improvement as it was only for a certain set of values, whereas we wanted to make it so that people using the programme could input their own values. 

Mahin, Alfie and Tom worked on creating differential, input and animated plotting programs. The development of these can be found on their various branches, each contributed to helping eachother but Alfie's programming was deemed to have the most potential and as such was used as a final program.

Each iteration of the developed programs, as seen on Tom's, Alfie's and Mahin's branches, grow in documentation and are all commit labelled with issues to be worked on.

Jake did all packaging operations and once communicating with Mahin, Alfie and Tom took the correct functional(ish) programs from the various branches and pushed it with the correct packaging files.

Amrit worked on setting initial conditions,plotting a potential at initial state and had a go at animating. Managed to plot wavefunction at a particular time, but struggling to actually animate.

Throughout the developmental stages Lizzie and Mahin managed issues with the group and communicated stages for development.

A lot of the groups communication was done in person and via alternate group chats, WhatsApp and Discord, but the crucial developmental steps are documented in the various issues.

The contents of each branch have a plethera of attempts at writing successful code and should be explored for further development, the package is not properly functional as it stands but does complete many of the requirements for the project.
