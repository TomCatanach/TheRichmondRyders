This repository contains my attempts at making a functional program

programs are listed in versions ascending from v0.1 to v0.6

The final program is "Schrodinger.py"

It has some major bugs that prevent it from correctly plotting the collision
between the potential and the wavefunction

I believe the error is somewhere with the handling of the V_x array in the schrodinger class

I, and my group, have been working on this for 30+ combined hours to little avail.

Im sure the issue is some logic error that will seem simple to solve, but it was not to us :(

The programs all have an issue where they will produce different outputs with the same numerical input.
This break in logic is confusing.....

The program is laid out well (imo) and does error handling effecitvely, but logically is incomplete.

EDIT: I dont think github insights is correctly monitoring who has pushed/contributed to the repository, I believe my account
has been seperated into three accounts
"Tom Catanach"
"Tom Catanach"
"Tom7Catanach"

strage.....
